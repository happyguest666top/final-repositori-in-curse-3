23,"They often don’t start in AI: Many AI developers come from diverse backgrounds like mathematics, physics, linguistics, psychology, or even philosophy. AI is such an interdisciplinary field that developers often bring unique perspectives from other areas, which helps in designing smarter and more human-centric systems.",,facts
24,"They spend more time on data than algorithms: A common misconception is that AI developers spend most of their time building complex models. In reality, a huge portion of their work goes into cleaning, organizing, and labeling data — the fuel that powers AI.",,facts
25,"They rely heavily on open-source tools: Most AI developers use open-source libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and scikit-learn. The AI community thrives on collaboration and shared knowledge, which means breakthroughs often come from tweaking existing tools rather than reinventing the wheel.",,facts
